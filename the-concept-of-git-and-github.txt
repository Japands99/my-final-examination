What Is Git?
First developed back in 2005, Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects.
Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions.
It can be used completely exclusive of any cloud-hosting service — you don’t even need internet access, except to download it. 
What Is GitHub?
In the discussion of Git vs. GitHub, it’s been said that GitHub is to Git what Facebook is to your actual face. What’s that mean?
Well, it means that while Facebook is kind of like an online face database (of sorts). GitHub is designed as a Git repository hosting service. 

And what exactly is a Git repository hosting service? It’s an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects outside of your local
computer/server. Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based. Also unlike Git, GitHub is a for-profit service (although basic repository-hosting features are available at no 
cost to those who are willing to create a user profile, making GitHub a popular choice for open-source projects).
